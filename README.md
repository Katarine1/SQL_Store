<h1>Store Database</h1>

<h4>Database script containing tables and relationships from one to many and many to many, in the case of this an additional table was created.</h4>

<h3>Tables:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>salesman</li>
  <li>product</li>
  <li>sells_product</li>
  <li>type</li>
  <li>description</li>
</ul>
